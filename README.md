ITCS 6150 Project 2: Solving N queens using Hill Climbing
Overview:
In this project we need to solve the N queens problem using Hill climbing. The N queens
problem is the problem of placing n queens onto an n x n chess board so that none of the
queens could attack each other. In this algorithm, we are representing the chessboard with an
array of Tile objects. If the tile contains a 1 then there is a queen present.
